Title: Telemetry Device Driver
Author: Will Howe

This repo contains a personal project consisting of a simple linux device driver simulating navigation
telemetry values from a sensor on-board a satellite vehicle. The data from the device is read by a user
space process and publishes out over a message broker.

Pre-requistes
=========================

1. Install the kernel headers

`sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers`

Instructions
=========================

1. Build the module

`make`

2. Load the module

`sudo insmod mock_sensor.ko`

3. Check that it was loaded properly

`sudo dmesg | tail`
`lsmod | grep mock_sensor`

4. Access the sensor values

`cat /sys/kernel/mock_sensor/temperature`
`cat /sys/kernel/mock_sensor/humidity`

5. You can also write new values

`echo 30 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mock_sensor/temperature`

6. Unload when done

`sudo rmmod mock_sensor`
